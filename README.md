# RV-Blog Website

Created a personal blog using Next.js, TypeScript, HyGraph, and GraphQL. Utilized these technologies to build a fast and modern web application with a flexible and powerful data layer powered by GraphQL. Implemented TypeScript for type-safe and scalable codebase. Incorporated HyGraph for efficient data fetching and manipulation.
